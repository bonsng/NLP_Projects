Tell me what you're feeling
I can take the pain
Tell me that you mean it
That you won't leave again

Tell me what your heart wants
Such a simple thing
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame
I can't make you see
If you don't by now
I'll get through these changes
Somehow, somehow

Take it if you want it
I'm so tired I just don't care
Can't you see how much you hurt me?
It's like I wasn't there

Tell me what your heart wants
Such a simple thing
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame
I can't make you see
If you don't by now
I'll get through these chains
Somehow, somehow

Tell me what your heart wants
Such a simple thing
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
