When you love someone - You'll do anything
You'll do all the crazy things - That you can't explain
You'll shoot the moon - Put out the sun
When you love someone
You'll deny the truth - Believe a lie
There'll be times that you'll believe - You could really fly
But your lonely nights - Have just begun
When you love someone
When you love someone - You'll feel it deep inside
And nothin else - Could ever change your mind
When you want someone - When you need someone
When you love someone
When you love someone - You'll sacrifice
You'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice
You'd risk it all - No matter what may come
When you love someone
You'll shoot the moon - Put out the sun
