You give me a sign
You give me a lift
You take me home when I've done my shift
You give me a loan
When I'm stone cold broke
Get me high, when I need a toke

I was born to love
I was born to love
I was born to love
I was born to

Times were tough
We made it through
We tasted the rough
So let's save the spoon
All the time I was hurtin' you
Got to believe that I was hurtin' too

I was born to love
I was born to
Born to love
I was born to
Your the only one I can talk to
The only one I can really read
I know you give because you want to
Don't you think it's time you learned to let yourself receive?

Can make you smile
Can make you sing
Just wanna give back a lil bit of what you give me
I could sing you a song
Play you a tune
I know its just a little thing but it's something I can do

I was born to love
I was born to
I was a-born to love
I was born to

I was born
To love you
I was born
To love youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
