Right now I feel
Just like a leaf on a breeze
Who knows where it's blowin'?
Who knows where it's goin'?
I find myself somewhere
I never thought I'd be
I'm going round in circles, yeah
Thinkin' bout you and me....
And how do I explain it when
I don't know what to say?
What do I do now?
So much has changed
Nothing I have ever known
Has made me feel this way
Nothing I have ever seen
Has made me want to stay
Here I am, ready for you
I'm torn and
I'm fallin'
I hear my home callin', hey!
I've never felt something so strong
Oh no
It's like nothing I've ever known...
You're the one I'm lookin' for
You're the one I need
You're the one that gives me
A reason to believe
Followin' our star
Has lead to where you are
I feel so strong now
This can't be wrong now...
Nothing I have ever known
Has made me feel this way
Nothing I have ever seen
Has made me want to stay
Here I am, ready for you
I'm torn and
I'm fallin'
I hear my home callin', hey!
I've never felt something so strong
Oh no
It's like nothing I've ever known
Nothing I've ever known...
Right now I feel
Just like a leaf on a breeze
Who knows where it's blowin'?
And who knows
Where I'm goin'....EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
