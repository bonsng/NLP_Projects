Had our share of the pain
Of the clouds and the rain
Lean on me and I’ll lean on you
And together, we’ll get through
We always do
We always do

I know you’re scared ‘cause you can’t see the light
You toss and turn through the night
Holding me, and I’m holding you
And together, we’ll get through
We always do
We always do
We always do

Where do you go when there’s no road to follow?
Faces look hollow, only strangers to you now
Where do you turn when this living starts to burn
Through layers that you learned to wrap around your heart somehow?
I turn to you
I always do
I turn to you
I know you’re scared, can’t see the light
Got to believe it’s gonna be alright
Lean on me and I’ll lean on you
And together, we’ll get through
We always do

We always do
We always do
We always do

We’ll make it through
We always do
We always doEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
