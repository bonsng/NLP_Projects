Zoe you and me we've been hanging out now
Ever since we were kids, just kicking around
This town
Zoe you know me and I don't back down
When I know what I want, and I think I found it

I want you, be my girl
I want you, be my girl
Zoe, you're so Supernova!
Super!

Zoe you know me and I'm on the right track
Gonna get out of here, never come back
Uh-uh!
Zoe you know me when I'm on the attack
Ain't no use in fighting back

I want you, be my girl
I want you, be my girl
Zoe, you're so Supernova!
Super!

When I'm low well I know who to call
When I think I'm bout to hit the wall
Zoe baby I know that you would never, never let me fall
Every time I turn around baby there you are
Just shining down on me like a blazing star
Yeah, that's what you are - you're a blazing star
That's what you are

Zoe, you're so Supernova!
Zoe, you're so Supernova!
Super!

Zoe you and me we've been hanging out now
Ever since we were kids, just kicking around
This town
Zoe you know me and I don't back down
When I know what I want, and I think I found it
I want you, be my girl
I want you, be my girl
Zoe, you're so Supernova!
Zoe, you're so Supernova!
Zoe, you're so Supernova!

Super!
Supernova!
