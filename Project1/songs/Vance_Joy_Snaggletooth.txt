Waiting for you, baby, through the coldest days
Huddled in the backseat of the van
And I know a girl who would wait until it's dark
When she sings, the heavens part
They part, ooh, ooh

And I held my ground
When I heard those sounds
Coming out
And I must have cried
When I held those hands
So, do you know what I mean?
So, do you know how I feel?
So, do you know what I mean?

And baby, don't you know that I love your snaggletooth?
I see it poking when you laugh
And baby, don't you know that I love those pigeon toes?
I hope that you get these pigeon lungs
Lungs, ooh

And I held my ground
When I heard those sounds
Coming up
And I must have cried
When I held your hands
So, do you know what I mean?
So, do you know how I feel?
So, do you know what I mean?
And I will try my best
To take this big old hen
And I will know his name
And always feel the same
And all lit up so bright
In the orange glow
And all lit up so bright
In the orange glow
Glow, oooh

And I held my ground
When I heard those sounds
Coming out
And I must have cried
When I held those hands
So, do you know what I mean?
So, do you know how I feel?
So, do you know? Do you know?
So, do you know? Do you know?
So, do you know? Do you know?
So, do you know? Do you know?
So, do you know what I mean?8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
