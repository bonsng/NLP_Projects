Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one-horse open sleigh (today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (today)
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
I love those JINGLE bells
Those holiday JINGLE bells
All those happy JINGLE BE double LES
I love those JINGLE bells
Jingle all the way
(Some other version:)
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Echo: Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot
A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead
