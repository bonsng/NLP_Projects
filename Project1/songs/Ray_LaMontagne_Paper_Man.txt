Here in my heart I am
Here in my heart I am
Here in my heart I am
Here in my heart I am

I won't live like a paper man
And step into life, the joy that I had
I won't fold like a paper man
To which I've been told by a paper-white plan

Hear me
Hear me
When I stay, I won't play for long
As long as I have a song, I'll sing
A song I'll sing

Here in my mind I am
Here in my mind I am
Here in my mind I am
Here in my mind I am

I won't live like a paper man
Step into life, the joy that I had
I won't fold like a paper man
To which I've been told by a paper-white plan
Hear me
Hear me
Hear me
Hear me

I won't live like a paper man
And step into life, the joy that I had
I won't fold like a paper man
To which I've been told by a paper-white plan

Hear me
Hear me
When I stay, I won't play for long
As long as I have a song, I'll sing
A song I'll sing

Here in my heart I am
Here in my heart I am
Here in my heart I stand
Here in my heart I standEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
