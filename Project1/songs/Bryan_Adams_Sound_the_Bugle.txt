Sound the bugle now
Play it just for me
As the seasons change
Remember how I used to be
Now I can't go on
I can't even start
I've got nothing left
Just an empty heart
I'm a soldier wounded
So I must give up the fight
There's nothing more for me
Lead me away... or leave me lying here
Sound the bugle now
Tell them I don't care
There's not a road I know
That leads to anywhere
Without a light, I fear that I will
Stumble in the dark
Lay right down, decide not to go on
Then from on high
Somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls
Remember who you are
If you lose yourself
Your courage soon will follow
So be strong tonight
Remember who you are
You're a soldier now
Fighting in a battle
To be free once more
That's worth fighting for6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
