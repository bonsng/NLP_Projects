There is a train that goes to nowhere
Need no ticket for you to ride
Put you in a car they call the sleeper
It's nice and warm inside
The days are never numbered
The nights don't matter at all
Your time is no longer counted
This train has got you now
Some folk can't get off
Mystery fates for you
There'll be no friends with you now
The ride is just for you

Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, you can ride
Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, you can ride

Can't sit down, can't stand up
No one will ever show
Things that used to be so real
Vanish from your soul
Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, you can ride
Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, yeah you can ride

The goal is never what it is
The goal will never be
The light stays dim a long time now
It's hard for you to see
Talk about the pathway
Way beyond your sign
Another time, another mind
That is the way of life

Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, you can ride

Wanna know what it is
What it's gonna be
You ride this train
No one left, only you and me
Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, you can ride
Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, it's warm inside
Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, you can ride
Train that goes to nowhere
You can ride, you can rideEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
