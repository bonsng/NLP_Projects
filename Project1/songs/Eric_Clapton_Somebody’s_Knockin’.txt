Somebody knocking
Somebody knocking at my door
Somebody knocking
Somebody knocking on my door
Well, it must be my woman
Coming 'round here for more
Somebody whispered
Somebody whispered in my ear
Somebody whispered
Somebody whispered in my ear
Oh, it must be my woman
I can feel her when she's near
O-o-o-o, she can get right down
O-o-o-o, she can get right down
Lord, it must be my woman
Pick me up when I am downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
