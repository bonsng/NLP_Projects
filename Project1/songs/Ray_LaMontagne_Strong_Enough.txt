I was raised up by my mama alone
Worked herself into the grave
Tryna make us a home
She never left South Carolina
No, nah
Our old man didn't stick around to see me grown
He was long gone 'fore the coffee got cold
Wouldn't even know where to find him

Woah, oh-oh-oh
Wasn't strong enough
Woah, oh-oh-oh
He wasn't strong enough
Alright, alright, alright, alright

I left home with nothing but a dream I had
All I own I could roll up in a paper bag
Getting out of South Carolina
Alright
I've been told there's gold in this land
All I know is what I hold in my own two hands
If it's out there I'm gonna find it
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Am I strong enough?
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Am I strong enough?

Everywhere you turn there's another man slamming doors
Looking at you like he wouldn't even let you sweep his floors

I was raised up by my mama on her own
Worked herself into the grave
Tryna make us a home
Never left South Carolina
I left home with nothing but a dream I had
All I own I could hold in a paper bag
Getting out of South Carolina

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Am I strong enough?
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Tell me, am I strong enough?
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Am I strong enough?
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Tell me, am I strong enough?
Am I strong enough?
Am I strong enough?
Am I strong enough?
Am I strong enough?

Oh, tell me
Am I strong enough?
Oh, got to tell me
Am I strong enough?
Oh, tell me
Am I strong enough?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
