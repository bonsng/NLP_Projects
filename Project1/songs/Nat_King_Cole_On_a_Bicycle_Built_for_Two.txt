Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer do
Im half crazy
All for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer do
Im half crazy
All for the love of you
We'll leave when the ball is over
Get married in the clover
And you'll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle made for twoEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
