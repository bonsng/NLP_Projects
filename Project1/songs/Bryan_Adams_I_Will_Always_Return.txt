I hear the wind call your name
It calls me back home again
The sparks of the fire, a flame that still burns
Oh it's to you I'll always return
Yeah...
I still feel your breath on my skin
I hear your voice deep within
The sound of my lover, a feeling so strong
Oh it's to you I'll always belong
Now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness, darling
Your light gets me through
Wanna swim in your river
Be warm by your sun
Bathe in your waters
'Cause you are the one!
I can't stand the distance
I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you
Yes I'm on my way home
I'm on my way...
I hear the wind call your name
The sound that leads me home again
The sparks of the fire, a flame that still burns
Oh, it's to you I will always return
Wanna swim in your river
Be warm by your sun
Bathe in your waters
'Cause you are the one!
I can't stand the distance
I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you
Yes I'm on my way home
Oh, I hear the wind call your name
The sound that leads me home again
The sparks of the fire, a flame that still burns
Yeah, I'm on way
I will always return
Yes, I will
Always return
I've seen every sunset and with all that I've learned
It's to you I will always, always return1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
