I got the key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
I'm going to leave here running
Walking is most too slow

I'm going back to the border
Woman, where I'm better known
You know you haven't done nothing
Drove a good man away from home

When the moon peeks over the mountains
I'll be on my way
I'm going to roam this old highway
Until the break of day
Oh, give me one, one more kiss mama
Just before I go
Because when I leave this time you know
I won't be back no more
