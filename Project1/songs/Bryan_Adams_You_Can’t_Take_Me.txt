Got to fight another fight, I gotta run another night
Get it out, check it out
I'm on my way and it don't feel right
I gotta get me back, I can't be beat and that's a fact
It's OK, I'll find a way
You ain't gonna take me down no way
Don't judge a thing until you know what's inside it
Don't push me, I'll fight it
Never gonna give in, never gonna give it up no
If you can't catch a wave then you're never gonna ride it
You can't come uninvited
Never gonna give in, never gonna give it up no
You can't take me I'm free
Why did it all go wrong ? I wanna know what's goin'on
And what's this holding me?
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I gotta fight another fight
I gotta fight with all my might
I'm getting out, so check it out
Ya - you're in my way
So you better watch out
Don't judge a thing until you know what's inside it
Don't push me, I'll fight it
Never gonna give in, never gonna give it up no
If you can't catch a wave then you're never gonna ride it
You can't come uninvited
Never gonna give in, never gonna give it up no
You can't take me I'm free
I'm, I'm free5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
