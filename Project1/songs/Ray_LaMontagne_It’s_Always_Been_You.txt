Since the first star split the black
Split the silence, too
Since the first dawn woke this Earth
Founded clothed in blue
Since the first birdsong was sung
As through the air it flew
It's been you
It's always been you
It's always been you

Since the first thrust of the sea
Life stemmed up on the shore
Since the first breath filled these lungs
Left them wanting more
Since the first your lips met mine
Soft as morning dew
It's been you
It's always been you
It's always been you

Led me out of the darkness
Fed my heart an ancient lie
Kept me close, kept me honest
I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
Since the first star split the black
The very light itself was moved
Since the first word moved the air
One syllable rang true
Since the first your eyes found mine
It was all at once I knew
It's been you
It's always been you
It's always been you
It's always been you
It's always been youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
