Stay for a little while
Share a glass beside the fire
Time goes by so fast, so fast
Let's make it last

Stay, stay and talk awhile
Share a laugh, share a smile
Days go by so fast, so fast
Let's make it last

Oh, years they roll and fall away
All the colors slowly fade to grey

Stay or watch another round
See the stars hang faster now
Why not wait and watch the sun
Circle back around again?

Oh, the hourglass is cruel
And the moment given is the moment spent
Stay for a little while
Share a glass beside the fire
Time goes by so fast, so fast
Let's make it last
Let's make it last
Let's make it last

Oh, the years they roll and fall away
All the colors slowly fade to greyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
