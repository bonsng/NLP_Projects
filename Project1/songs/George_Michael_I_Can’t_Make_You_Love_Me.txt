Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
Here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power
But you won't
No you won't
'And I can't make you love me
If you don't

I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you do not feel
When you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'And I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power
But you won't
No you won't
'And I can't make you love me
If you don't

Ain't no use in you trying
It's no good for me, baby
Without love
All my tears, all these years
Everything
I believed in
Baby
Oh yeah
Someone's gonna love me
