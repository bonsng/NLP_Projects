When times are hard
And friends are few
And you need someone
To help you through

Just call my name
And I’ll come running to your side
Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there

When morning comes
And nothing’s changed
And the world outside
Plays the same old game

Just call on me
And I will ease your lonely heart
Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid
I will be there
(When you are lost, lost in the night)
I will be there
(Nowhere to turn)
I will be there
(Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid)
I will be there
(When everyone that you believed)
I will be there
(Still lets you down)
I will be there
(Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid)

Just call my name
And I’ll come running to your side
Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid
I will be there
(When you are lost, lost in the night)
I will be there
(Nowhere to turn)
I will be there
(Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid)
I will be there
(When everyone that you believed)
I will be there
(Still lets you down)
I will be there
(Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid)
I will be there

(When you are lost, lost in the night)
(Nowhere to turn)
(Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid)
(When everyone that you believed)
(Still lets you down)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
