I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy
"Save me, if you please!"
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by
I am going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
I am going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrelhouse, baby
On the riverside
You can run, you can run
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
You can run, you can run
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
And I am standing at the crossroads
Believe I am sinking down2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
