To really love a woman, to understand her
You've got to know her deep inside
Hear every thought, see every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself
Lying helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's the one
She needs somebody to tell her
That it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
To really love a woman, let her hold you
Till you know how she needs to be touched
You've got to breathe her, really taste her
Till you can feel her in your blood
And when you see
Your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's the one
She needs somebody to tell her
That it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
You've got to give her some faith, hold her tight
A little tenderness, you've got to treat her right
She will be there for you taking good care of you
You really gotta love your woman
And when you find yourself
Lying helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's the one
She needs somebody to tell her
That it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
Just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
Just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
