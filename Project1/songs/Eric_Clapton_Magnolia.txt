Whip-poor-will singing
Soft summer breeze
Makes me think of my baby
I left down in New Orleans
I left down in New Orleans

Magnolia, you sweet thing
You're driving me mad
Gotta get back to you, babe
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had

You whisper "Good morning"
So gently in my ear
I'm coming home to you, babe
I'll soon be there
I'll soon be there

Magnolia, you sweet thing
You're driving me mad
I've gotta get back to you, babe
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
