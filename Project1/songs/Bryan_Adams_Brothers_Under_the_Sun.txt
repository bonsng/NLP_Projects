I had a dream of the wide open prairie
I had a dream of the pale mornin' sky
I had a dream that we flew on golden wings
And we were the same, just the same, you and I
Follow your heart, little child of the west wind
Follow the voice that's callin' you home
Follow your dreams, but always remember me
I am your brother, yeah, under the sun
We are like birds of a feather
We are two hearts joined together
We will be forever as one
My brother under the sun
Wherever you hear the wind in the canyon
Wherever you see the buffalo run
Wherever you go, I'll be there beside you
'Cause you are my brother, my brother under the sun
We are like birds of a feather
We are two hearts joined together
We will be forever as one
My brother under the sun, under the sun
Under the sun, my brother under the sun1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
