Well I don't look good in no Armani suits
No Gucci shoes - or designer boots
I've tried the latest lines from A to Z
But there's just one thing that looks good on me
The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you
I'm not satisfied with Versace style
Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good
But there's only one thing that fits like it should
The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you
Yeah it's you - it could only be you
Nobody else will ever do
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to
Ya we stick like glue
The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you
The only thing I want - Yeah
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
