I'm so gone
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
You cut through
And I just wanna know what's in your head

Write it on a piece of paper, honey, mmm
Put it in my coat before I go

Hidden in a place you know I'll find it, oh ohh
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby

Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Snow comes down
Everything is new
And different
I found you
Hidden in plain sight
Why'd I take so long?

Write it on a piece of paper, honey, mmm
Put it in my coat before I go

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby, yeah

Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Ohh oh ohh
Ohh oh ohh
Ohh oh ohh
Ohh oh ohh

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down
Oh baby, babe

Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
