You were born in a small town
Always had dreams bigger than your brother, you know it
Hit the road where it forks down
Made good decisions, start from the gutter, you know it
Big city lives, fast lane living but
You never forgot your roots, oh ooh
Back in town, daddy's advice
Baby don’t forget that you
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everyone you know
Shine a light
Shine a light
You've struggled before now
Each time you made out the other side
Pick yourself up when you fall down
Stand tall and never be afraid to cry
Big city life, same thing, different town
Darling don't forget your roots, well
Back in town, momma’s advice
Baby don't forget that you
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
With everyone you know
Shine a light, yeah
Shine a light
People love and people cry
People live and people die
And I'll never meet another life like you
Every day and every night
Teaching you wrong from right
Now you get to shine a light don't you, don't you
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Let everybody know
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
With everyone you know
Shine a light
Shine a light
Hey
