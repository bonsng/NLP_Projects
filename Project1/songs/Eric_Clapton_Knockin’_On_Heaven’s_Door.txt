Ma, take this badge off of me
I can't use it any more
It is getting dark, too dark to see
Feel like I am knocking on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door

Ma, take these guns away from me
I can't shoot them anymore
There's a long black cloud following me
Feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door

Ma, take this badge off of me
I can't use it any more
It is getting dark, too dark to see
Feel like I am knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
