Why so many people always runnin' 'round
Looking for a happiness that can't be found?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

For everyone resplendent in the wealth of kings
Thousands upon thousands only suffering
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

I want to be part of the light
Please let me be part of the light
I want to be part of the light
I choose to be part of the light
Our light

Why so many people only close their hearts?
Turn their eyes as others' lives are torn apart?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
When kindness is the greatest gift that one can share
Why choose hate to subjugate your fellow man?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

I want to be part of the light
Please let me be part of the light
I want to be part of the light
I choose to be part of the light
Our light
