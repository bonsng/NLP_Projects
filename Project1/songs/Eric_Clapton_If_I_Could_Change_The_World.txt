If I could reach the stars, pull one down for you
Shine it on your heart so you could see the truth
That this love I have inside, is everything it seems
But for now I find, it's only in my dreams
If I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
And if I could be king, even for a day
I'd take you as my queen, I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule, this kingdom we had made
Till then I'd be a fool, wishing for the day
That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
If I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the worldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
