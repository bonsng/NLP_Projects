You speak to me in sign language
As I am eating a sandwich in a small cafe
At a quarter to three

But I cannot respond to your sign language
You are taking advantage, bringing me down
Can't you make any sound?

It was there by the bakery, surrounded by fakery
This is my story, still I am still there
Does she know I still care?

Link Wray was playing on a jukebox, I was paying
For the words I was saying, so misunderstood
He did not do me no good
