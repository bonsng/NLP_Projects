Have you ever loved a woman?
So much you tremble in pain?
Have you ever loved a woman>
So much you tremble in pain?
And all the time you know
She bears another man his name
But you just love that woman
So much, it's a shame and a sin
You just love that woman
So much, it's a shame and a sin
But all the time you know
She belongs to your very best friend

Have you ever loved a woman?
And you know you cannot leave her alone?
Have you ever loved a woman?
And you know you cannot leave her alone?
Something deep inside of you
Will not let you wreck your best friend's home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
