Walk in the front door, drop my keys
Take my shoes off and go
Straight into your arms; keep me safe
And I don't feel like myself
I been waiting to go
Straight into your arms; keep me safe

Ooh, I've been gone since yesterday
And I fell straight, straight into your arms
Ooh, but it only takes one day
And I run straight, straight into your arms
Straight into your arms
Straight into your arms, straight into your arms

You keep me on track
I can't sleep 'til you come back home to me
Into my arms, baby
So let's make the best of what we have
Time is precious; it won't last
I see you and I get back

Ooh, I've been gone since yesterday
And I fell straight, straight into your arms
Ooh, but it only takes one day
And I run straight, straight into your arms
Straight into your arms
Straight into your arms, straight into your arms
And I've been waiting, I'm waiting
My heart is calling, it's calling

Ooh, I've been gone since yesterday
And I fell straight, straight into your arms
Ooh, but it only takes one day
And I run straight, straight into your arms
Straight into your arms
Ooh, I've been gone since yesterday
And I fell straight, straight into your arms
Ooh, but it only takes one day
And I run straight, straight into your arms
Straight into your arms, straight into your armsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
