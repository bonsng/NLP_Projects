Oh, if you're losing sleep
Oh, if you're losing sleep, scared of shadows
Oh, see it's just a chair, see the clothes hang there
Oh, don't go losing sleep, scared of shadows

Oh, don't feel bad
I never have
Since I got you
My Emmylou

You wear your socks to bed
You wear your socks to bed, that's what I do
Oh, come on, sleepyhead, get yourself to bed
Don't go losin' all the nighttime

Oh, don't feel bad
I never have
Since I got you
My Emmylou

You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved
Oh, don't feel bad
(You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved)
I never have
(You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved)
Since I've got you
(You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved)
Oh, now, my Emmylou8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
