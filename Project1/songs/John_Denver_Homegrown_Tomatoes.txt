Ain't nothin' in the world that I like better
Than bacon an' lettuce n' homegrown tomatoes
Up in the mornin', an' out in the garden
Get you a ripe one, don't get a hard 'un
Plant 'em in the spring, you eat 'em in the summer
All winter without 'em's a culinary bummer
I forgot all about the sweatin' and the diggin'
Every time I go out and pick me a big'un

Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
Only two things that money can't buy
And that's true love and homegrown tomatoes

Well, you can go out a'eat, that's for sure
But there's nothin' that a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your own, very own tomato juice
You can eat 'em with eggs, can eat 'em with gravy
You can eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
Put 'em on the side, put 'em in the middle
Homegrown tomato on a hot cake griddle

Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
Only two things that money can't buy
And that's true love and homegrown tomatoes

If I's to change this life I lead
You could call me Johnny Tomatoseed
'Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes'n every yard you see
When I die, don't bury me
In a box in a cold, dark cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
'Cause I could be a-pushin' up a-homegrown tomatoes

Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
There's only two things that money can't buy
And that's true love and homegrown tomatoes
Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
There's only two things that money can't buy
And that's true love and homegrown tomatoes
