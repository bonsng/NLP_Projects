Last Saturday night, I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
Gonna take another stroll downtown

Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Stop rambling, stop your gambling
Stop staying out late at night
Come home to your wife and your family
And sit by the fire so bright


I love Irene, God knows I do
Love her 'til the rivers run dry
If Irene should ever turn her back on me
Gonna take morphine and die
