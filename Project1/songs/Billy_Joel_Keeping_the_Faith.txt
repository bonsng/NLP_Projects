If it seems like I've been lost
In let's remember
If you think I'm feeling older
And missing my younger days
Oh, then you should
Have known me much better
'Cause my past is something that never
Got in my way, oh no

Still I would not be here now
If I never had the hunger
And I'm not ashamed to say
The wild boys were my friends
Oh, 'cause I never felt the desire
Until their music set me on fire
And then I was saved, yeah

That's why I'm keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith

We wore matador boots
Only Flagg Brothers had them
With a Cuban heel
Iridescent socks with the same color shirt
And a tight pair of chinos
Oh, I put on my shark skin jacket
You know the kind with the velvet collar
And ditty-bop shades, oh yeah
I took a fresh pack of Luckies
And a mint called Sen-Sen
My old man's Trojans
And his Old Spice after shave
Oh, combed my hair in a pompadour
Like the rest of the Romeos wore
A permanent wave, Yeah

We were keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith

You can get just so much
From a good thing
You can linger too long in your dreams
Say goodbye to the oldies but goodies
Because the good ole days
Weren't always good
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems

Learned stickball as a formal education
Lost a lot of fights
But it taught me how to lose O.K
Oh, I heard about sex
But not enough
I found you could dance
And still look tough anyway
Oh, yes I did
I found out a man ain't just being macho
Ate an awful lot of late night drive-in food
Drank a lot of take home pay
I thought I was the Duke of Earl
When I made it with a red-haired girl
In a Chevrolet, oh yeah

We were keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith

You know the good ole days
Weren't always good
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems

I told you my reasons
For the whole revival
Now I'm going outside to have
An ice cold beer in the shade
Oh, I'm going to listen to my 45's
Ain't it wonderful to be alive
When the rock 'n' roll plays, yeah
When the memory stays, yeah
I'm keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith

We were keeping the faith
We were keeping the faith
I'm keeping the faith
Oh, you know I willEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
